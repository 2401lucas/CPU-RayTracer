# Ray Tracer
Currently the ray tracer is a partial setup of a feature complete ray tracer. It uses single hit tracers to derive colors from a mock scene setup. It is single threaded although the current structure of processing rays 
is adaptable to multithreading and path tracing.
## Key Features
- SIMD

## TODO
- BVH
- Scenes (.gltf?)
- Multithreading
- Bounces
- Interface to modify renders (Reso, depth, samples, scene...)
